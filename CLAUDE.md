## project-status: commit + daily-plan discipline

This repo is monitored by [`project-status`](https://github.com/cornjacket/project-status): it reconstructs activity from your **git history** and aggregates your `daily-plan.md` across every tracked repo. **Read [`project-status-guide.md`](project-status-guide.md)** (repo root) before writing a daily plan, or whenever a commit message needs more than the rules below.

### Commits

1. Every commit follows this shape. `[Context]` and `[Impact]` are required on any non-trivial commit (a typo or pure formatting may omit them):

   ```
   <domain>(<scope>): <high-level functional summary>
   - [Context]: why this was done / what was learned
   - [Impact]: how it alters the project or system behavior
   ```

2. Title the **system change, not the files**, and write it for a reader who has never seen this repo — these messages are summarized across the whole portfolio. `feat(auth): let users reset a forgotten password by email`, not `add token TTL check to reset handler`.

3. Commit at **task granularity** — never per-prompt — and commit completed work **before the session ends**. Uncommitted work is invisible to the tracker.

4. Immediately after committing, print `✅ <short-hash> — <title>` on its own line.

### Daily plan (`daily-plan.md`, repo root)

5. The first line is exactly `# Daily plan — YYYY-MM-DD` and nothing else — no repo URL. The file is **one** day's plan: always overwritten, never appended.

6. Write the *next* day's plan only when the user explicitly asks to plan ahead — not on an ambiguous "let's stop here". On Friday, write Monday's.
