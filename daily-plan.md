# Daily plan — 2026-05-29

Decide the workflow methodology for this project going forward. Researched the field
(GSD, Superpowers, Claude Skills, chub, Everything Claude Code, paperclip, RooFlow, Open Design)
via parallel subagents. Decision: **switch to Superpowers** for this project (single framework,
not stacked with GSD). Rationale: small greenfield TS/Node pipeline is an ideal TDD fit, fresh
learning ground that feeds the homegrown ai-builder framework, and low-risk to trial at this size.
Two known gaps to own deliberately: (a) no LLM/eval phase like GSD's AI-SPEC / eval-review — will
hand-spec the eval or author an own eval skill; (b) draft-quality is non-deterministic, so TDD
covers the plumbing while a separate Gemini-as-judge eval loop covers generation. The log.md /
daily-plan.md / ai-project-status discipline is framework-agnostic and stays. Next: set up
Superpowers and start brainstorm on the 6 blocking open questions toward SPEC.md.

   replace GSD, keep ai-builder log     own the eval loop separately
